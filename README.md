# 🧹 SQL Data Cleaning & Standardization Project

This project focuses on improving data quality through SQL-based cleaning and standardization techniques. Using structured queries, we prepare a raw dataset for accurate and meaningful analysis.

## 🔧 Key Tasks Performed:
- ✂️ Trimming blank spaces
- 🔄 Fixing datatype inconsistencies
- 🗑️ Deleting irrelevant rows and columns
- 🧱 Handling NULL values

Every query in this project is crafted to enhance data integrity and ensure the dataset is fully analysis-ready.
